The standardized R package documentation is part of the appeal for new (and experienced) users, where concise, clear instructions are cherished. Packages are great for reusing scripts in a consistent fashion and for developers, package creation helps organizing and maintaining their ideas. The barrier to entry for package maintenance and documentation, however may be too high for R users embarking on the task of package creation, thereby discouraging them from development. The out-of-the-box roxygen2 skeleton supplied by RStudio gives the bare bones road map of what should be part of function documentation. The goal of sinew is to automate nearly all of the manual tasks needed to document functions, properly set up the import fields for oxygenation, and make it easier to attain documentation consistency across functions and packages. Once the initial documentation is set, sinew can be used as part of the natural maintenance workflow to automatically change and append updated parameters, definitions, defaults, add namespacing to functions and dependencies, making your documentation great - again! Sinew is built for both command line and interactive users through a Shiny gadget that can be called from the addin menu. The addin can be used on any function either installed, in the search path, one you just wrote, or one your need to update. "],

["motive.html", "Chapter 2 Motivation 2.1 Quick Turnaraound 2.2 Working Example", " Chapter 2 Motivation How can sinew help you? sinew automates tasks that are part of R package documentation and maintance in order to help developers consistently create robust roxygen2 documentation and pass R CMD check --as-cran. 2.1 Quick Turnaraound Two common scenarios arise in package development You start a new project and open a file to develop your idea. Many functions later at the end of the day you look up and you have created a mess of a file. You recieve a mammoth 10,000 line uncommented file to decipher for QC - good luck. Sinew can help turn the around that headache into a CRAN ready package in a few short steps Open a package project in Rstudio. Place the file in the data-raw folder. Run untangle on the large script with the destination directory ../R. This will separate the core functions in the body into single function files (named as the function) and keep the body in body.R Run pretty_namespace to append any missing namespaces in the function scripts. Run makeOxyFile with the path set to R. Run makeImport to create the correct Imports in the DESCRIPTION file and paste it in the the DESCRIPTION file. This should get you far enough to make the impossible problem of understanding what is in that file to a manageable task, with the added benefit of producing a new package ready for distribution. 2.2 Working Example Lets use a reproducible example - The goal is to convert raw script in a file called test.R into a package. The file includes two functions yy and zz and some general script that uses them #some comment yy &lt;- function(a=4){ head(runif(10),a) # a comment } zz &lt;- function(v=10,a=8){ head(runif(v),a) } yy(6) zz(30,3) To start we initialize a R subdirectory and a DESCRIPTION file. dir.create(&#39;R&#39;) devtools::create_description() 2.2.1 Untangling Files One of the first tasks for new developers is to move from long scripts that are intertwined with functions and body code into single function files in a R subdirectory and a clean body script that is easier to read. This task is probably a non-starter if you have more than a few hundered lines of code. This is where untangle can save you time. untangle will separate the long script into single function files in a subdirectory and keep the body script intact. untangle(file = &#39;test.R&#39;,dir.out = &#39;R&#39;) As we can see we got three new files. body.R in the working directory yy.R in the R subdirectory zz.R in the R subdirectory 2.2.2 Namespacing It has become common practice to use the namespace in function calls, and it is obligatory in order to pass a cran check. But, not everyone does it and if you’re not use to it, it’s a pain to go back and update your script. This is where pretty_namespace comes in. This function will go through your script and attach namespaces for you, with the same logic as the search path. pretty_namespace(&#39;R&#39;,overwrite = TRUE) So now we have separate files with functions appropriatly associated with namespaces, and now we can add roxygen2 headers. 2.2.3 Documentation Now we are ready to create the function documentation using roxygen2. We use makeOxygen to create a skeleton for roxygen2 documentation. This function returns a skeleton that includes title, description, return, import and other fields populated with information scraped from the function script. We can also run makeOxygen in batch mode using makeOxyfile. makeOxyFile(&#39;R&#39;,overwrite = TRUE) Lets see what we got back in zz.R: #&#39; @title FUNCTION_TITLE #&#39; @description FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION #&#39; @param v PARAM_DESCRIPTION, Default: 10 #&#39; @param a PARAM_DESCRIPTION, Default: 8 #&#39; @return OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION #&#39; @details DETAILS #&#39; @examples #&#39; \\dontrun{ #&#39; if(interactive()){ #&#39; #EXAMPLE1 #&#39; } #&#39; } #&#39; @seealso #&#39; \\code{\\link[utils]{head}} #&#39; \\code{\\link[stats]{runif}} #&#39; @rdname zz #&#39; @export #&#39; @author Jonathan Sidi #&#39; @importFrom utils head #&#39; @importFrom stats runif zz &lt;- function(v=10,a=8){ utils::head(stats::runif(v),a) } The premise of makeOxygen is to expand on the default skeleton in RStudio, so basic fields are in the output by default. Each field is given with a relevant placeholder giving a hint what is expected. The following is the meat add to these bones: param default values: If a default value is set for a function parameter it will be added to the end @param line. import/importFrom The package scrapes the script with makeImport looking for declared namespaces to create the proper calls for @import and @importFrom which are placed at the bottom of the output. seealso linking to other packages is also taken care of when adding the field @seealso. Any functions that are included in @importFrom will have a link to them by default. 2.2.4 Description It is also important to update the package description file Imports field. This can be done for you with makeImport, by either creating a new Imports field or updating an existing one. makeImport(&#39;R&#39;,format = &#39;description&#39;,desc_loc = &#39;.&#39;) 2.2.5 Update documentation An important part of maintaining a package is keeping the documentation updated. Using moga we can achieve this painlessly. moga runs the same underlying script as moga but appends new information found into the current roxygen2 header instead of creating a new one. Lets say we updated yy.R to include another param and used another function from the stats package. So the roxygen2 header is now out of synch with the current script. #some comment #&#39; @title FUNCTION_TITLE #&#39; @description FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION #&#39; @param a numeric, set the head to trim from random unif Default: 4 #&#39; @return OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION #&#39; @details DETAILS #&#39; @examples #&#39; \\dontrun{ #&#39; if(interactive()){ #&#39; #EXAMPLE1 #&#39; } #&#39; } #&#39; @seealso #&#39; \\code{\\link[utils]{head}} #&#39; \\code{\\link[stats]{runif}} #&#39; @rdname yy #&#39; @export #&#39; @author Jonathan Sidi #&#39; @importFrom utils head #&#39; @importFrom stats runif yy &lt;- function(a=4,b=2){ x &lt;- utils::head(stats::runif(10*b),a) stats::quantile(x,probs=.95) # a comment } moga(&#39;R/yy.r&#39;,overwrite = TRUE) 2.2.6 Oxygenize and Check 2.2.6.1 Oxygenize devtools::document() Updating test documentation Loading test First time using roxygen2.

Initial Package Build Create a _sinewconfig.yml file in package/project root folder. Set any persistent definitions such as author name and default fields to be generated for all functions. Develop R script for the package using proper namespacing definitions, i.e. package::function, or use pretty_namespace. Focus only on the function and package logic. Run makeOxygen (single file) or makeOxyFile (directory) to create skeletons. It is suggested to use the styler package beforehand to have ensure proper R script syntax conventions.

The defaults settings for the core function parameters in sinew are defined in sinew_opts. These include the roxygen2 fields and their values to include by default in the function header. These settings will persist for a R session.

The user highlights a text in the Source editor and sinew will interpret that as the input object of makeOxygen or moga. To access the addins load sinew (library(sinew)) and then two addins are appended to the Addins menu of RStudio. 5.1 createOxygen (Static) This addin will insert above the highlighted text the output of makeOxygen. It is useful to control the fields and their values with sinew_opts. 5.2 InteractiveOxygen (Interactive) This addin invokes a shiny gadget. The user can select to either create a new skeleton or update an existing file. The application search for highlighted text in a number of locations in order to create the documentation. The application has checkboxes to control what fields are in the documentation, and there is a reactive preview tab to see what the documentation looks like as fields are inserted or removed. It is useful to control the fields checked on by default and their values with sinew_opts. Once the user is happy with the documention skeleton it can be inserted into the editor. Creating a new skeleton: Script within the source editor can be in either named tabs (saved files) or unnamed tabs (untitled1) Highlighted text can be functions that are one of following compiled uncompiled attached namespace (package in search path) unattached namespace (package that is installed) Updating existing documentation on disk In this case there has to be a physical location for the application to read.

In this chapter we will describe in detail all the command line functionality. The goal of these functions is to reliably produce CRAN ready documentation and namespace managment that is compatible with roxygen2. But at the end of the day this package is only meant to create a fleshed out skeleton and the actual content is up to the developer. 6.1 makeImport When you are building a package to submit to CRAN and you need to have namespace calls for any function that is being imported. It is a pain to manually parse through the code looking for all the :: and writing it in the roxygen2 header. This function does that for you. You can write normally your script with the namespace calls and in the end run the function and you can paste the output into the header. (or use it as part of makeOxygen or makeOxyFile) The function is written to work on single files or whole directories, like a package R subdirectory. The output can be set to return the format needed for either an roxygen2 header, NAMESPACE or the DESCRIPTION myDir &lt;- &#39;../../R&#39; 6.1.1 DESCRIPTION makeImport(script=myDir,format = &#39;description&#39;) To write the output directly into the Imports field of the DESCRIPTION file, specify path to DESCRIPTION in desc_loc makeImport(myDir,format = &#39;description&#39;, desc_loc=&#39;&lt;PATH TO DESCRIPTION&gt;&#39;) 6.1.2 roxygen2 #single file makeImport(script=file.path(myDir,&#39;makeImport.R&#39;),format = &#39;oxygen&#39;) #whole directory makeImport(script=myDir,format = &#39;oxygen&#39;) 6.1.3 importFrom cutoff Setting the parameter cut to an integer value allows for control of how many functions to list in a package before concatenating the importFrom to an import. This is useful when there are many functions being used throughout the package from the same library and it is practically the same as just importing the whole library #without cut makeImport(script=file.path(myDir,&#39;oxygenAddin.R&#39;),format = &#39;oxygen&#39;) #with cut makeImport(script=file.path(myDir,&#39;oxygenAddin.R&#39;),format = &#39;oxygen&#39;,cut=2) 6.2 makeOxygen Function that returns the skeleton for roxygen2 documentation including title, description, return, import and other fields populated with information scraped from the function script. 6.2.1 Basic Usage makeOxygen is the main function in the package. Running the default setting returns a skeleton with minimal required fields to run devtools::check(build_args = '--as-cran'): title, description, and param. Adding Some Meat to the Bones… The added value of sinew is that it scrapes the script and fills in many important holes in the documentation: param default values: if a default value is set for a function parameter it will be added to the end @param line. import/importFrom It is assumed that the developer is abiding by the CRAN rules and uses the proper namespace syntax package::function when calling functions in the script. The package scrapes the script with makeImport to create the proper calls for @import and @importFrom which are placed at the bottom of the output. The user has control the number of functions that are listed in importFrom package function1 [ function2 …] until only @import package is returned (more below). seealso linking to other packages is also taken care of when adding the field @seealso. Any functions that are included in @importFrom will have a link to them by default.

PARAM_DESCRIPTION ## #&#39; @return OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION 6.3 makeOxyFile Function authored by: Anton Grishin While makeOxygen is the workhorse for the package it does only print out to the console or a object in the current environment. makeOxyFile is a wrapper function for makeOxygen in order to actively insert makeOxygen outputs into existing or new files. By default makeOxyFile will not overwrite existing files, but will make a copy of the file and name it oxy-filename.R. An empty call will envoke the system file selection dialogue. makeOxyFile() Single File makeOxyFile(&quot;./myRfunctions/utils.R&quot;) Batch mode for a directory makeOxyFile(&quot;./myRfunctions&quot;) Additional parameters to makeOxygen can be passed through makeOxyFile(&quot;./myRfunctions/utils.R&quot;, cut = 5) 6.4 moga After initially getting the documentation just right there comes the endless task of package maintanance. Revising functions is a natural part of the workflow, but a collateral effect of updating script is that the documentation needs to be updated too. This can include changes to the parameter inputs (function formals) or switching the internal function dependency from on package to another. This is where moga can help. moga is an acronym for make oxygen great again. moga will rerun cross check the current documentation of an R script and the current script itself and update/add any parameters/defaults/imports discrepancies. This allows the developer to focus on function improvment without having to interrupt the train of thought to focus on documentation. moga can print to console for dry runs or it can overwrite the current file. The example below shows a function that a parameter (a) was added to the formals, and there is a value already in the @return field. readLines(&#39;../moga_test_cli.R&#39;) We see that the new parameter was added belows @param v and the @return field was preserved. moga(path = &#39;../moga_test_cli.R&#39;) If you need to force an existing field to have the default sinew value, then use the force.fields option moga(&#39;../moga_test_cli.R&#39;,force.fields = &#39;return&#39;) 6.5 rmOxygen Function authored by: Anton Grishin Strip roxygen2 preambles from a file rmOxygen(&quot;./myRfunctions/function1.R&quot;) 6.6 makeDictionary This function takes the idea of roxygen2 templates, but repurposes their use. It creates an R file of all the unique roxygen2 parameter fields in a package R subdirectory. This serves a few functions: Creates a general template for regular use with roxygen2 Simple way to check that there are no redundant parameter descriptions and that they are consistent. When present, this is used internally with ls_param to call parameter descriptions in bulk from a centralized template to populate makeOxygen skeletons. For example in the man-roxygen there is a Dictionary-1.R file that was created by makeDictionary. Using ls_param a query is run on the dictionary to return the param fields that intersect with the formals call to the functions. dict_loc &lt;- &#39;https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/sinew/blob/master/man-roxygen/Dictionary-1.R&#39; #without dictionary makeOxygen(makeImport) #with dictionary makeOxygen(makeImport,use_dictionary = dict_loc) 6.7 tabular Utility function to convert a data.frame to roxygen2 tabular format cat(sinew::tabular(mtcars[1:5, 1:5])) ## #&#39; \\tabular{rrrrr}{ ## #&#39; \\strong{mpg} \\tab \\strong{cyl} \\tab \\strong{disp} \\tab \\strong{hp} \\tab \\strong{drat}\\cr ## #&#39; 21.0 \\tab 6 \\tab 160 \\tab 110 \\tab 3.90\\cr ## #&#39; 21.0 \\tab 6 \\tab 160 \\tab 110 \\tab 3.90\\cr ## #&#39; 22.8 \\tab 4 \\tab 108 \\tab 93 \\tab 3.85\\cr ## #&#39; 21.4 \\tab 6 \\tab 258 \\tab 110 \\tab 3.08\\cr ## #&#39; 18.7 \\tab 8 \\tab 360 \\tab 175 \\tab 3.15 ## #&#39;} cat(sinew::tabular(mtcars[1:5, 1:5],header=FALSE)) ## #&#39; \\tabular{rrrrr}{ ## #&#39; 21.0 \\tab 6 \\tab 160 \\tab 110 \\tab 3.90\\cr ## #&#39; 21.0 \\tab 6 \\tab 160 \\tab 110 \\tab 3.90\\cr ## #&#39; 22.8 \\tab 4 \\tab 108 \\tab 93 \\tab 3.85\\cr ## #&#39; 21.4 \\tab 6 \\tab 258 \\tab 110 \\tab 3.08\\cr ## #&#39; 18.7 \\tab 8 \\tab 360 \\tab 175 \\tab 3.15 ## #&#39;} 6.8 untangle Utility function that splits a R script with multiple functions into multiple single function R files. This is great for when you recieve endlessly long R scripts that you need to organize quickly. untangle can be used in conjunction with makeOxyFile in batch mode to quickly turn around long R files into a CRAN ready package within minutes. txt &lt;- &quot;#some comment #&#39; @import utils yy &lt;- function(a=4){ utils::head(runif(10),a) # a comment } v &lt;- 20 #another comment #&#39; @import utils zz &lt;- function(v=10,a=3){ utils::head(runif(v),pmin(a,v)) } zz(v) &quot; x &lt;- untangle(text = txt) sapply(x,cat,sep=&#39;\\n&#39;) #$yy # #some comment # #&#39; @import utils # yy &lt;- function(a=4){ # utils::head(runif(10),a) # # a comment # } # #$zz # #another comment # #&#39; @import utils # zz &lt;- function(v=10,a=3){ # utils::head(runif(v),pmin(a,v)) # } # #$body #v &lt;- 20 # #zz(v) 6.9 pretty_namespace Autoappend namespace to functions in script by searchpath order.
